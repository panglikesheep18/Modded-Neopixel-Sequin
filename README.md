Please note these LEDs require 5V input, if there's no 5V feed on one of wire, you might need to feed one, you also need to feed some extra cables for data transmission for LEDs.

BOM: 2X 1515 LED per piece (8 total) (https://www.lcsc.com/product-detail/Light-Emitting-Diodes-span-style-background-color-ff0-LED-span_Foshan-NationStar-Optoelectronics-FC-RGBC1515-A1_C7464731.html), 1X 22uf 0603 capactior per piece (4 total) (https://www.lcsc.com/product-detail/Multilayer-Ceramic-Capacitors-MLCC-SMD-SMT_Walsin-Tech-Corp-0603X226M100CT_C2992620.html)(for buffering), some assembly may be required if you ordered it through PCB prototype sites (JLCPCB or PCBWay) and some extra cables for data lines.
